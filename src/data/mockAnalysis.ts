    'No clear refund policy stated',

      originalText: 'The Licensor grants the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Software solely for internal business purposes, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any usage limitations specified in the applicable Order Form.',
      simplifiedText: 'You can use this software for your business, but you cannot share it with others or transfer your access to someone else. The company can take away your access if you break the rules.',
      riskLevel: 'fine',
      riskExplanation: 'This is a standard licensing clause that protects the software company\'s intellectual property while giving you the right to use the product. The terms are reasonable and common in software agreements.',
      realWorldImpact: 'You have the right to use the software as intended. Just remember that you cannot share your login with others or sell your access.',
      roleExplanations: {
        tenant: 'As a tenant using property management software, this means you can use the platform to manage your rental properties but cannot share your subscription with other property managers.',
        employee: 'If your company purchased this software, you can use it for work tasks, but you should not share login credentials with colleagues who are not authorized users.',
        customer: 'You have full access to use the service as described, but your account is personal to you and cannot be transferred to someone else.',

      simplifiedText: 'Your subscription will automatically renew every year unless you cancel at least 90 days before your renewal date.',
      riskLevel: 'risky',
      riskExplanation: 'The 90-day notice requirement is longer than industry standard (typically 30 days). This could result in being locked into another year if you forget to cancel in time.',
      realWorldImpact: 'If you want to cancel, you need to remember to do so 3 months before your renewal date. Missing this window means paying for another full year.',
      roleExplanations: {
        tenant: 'Mark your calendar! You need to decide whether to continue 3 months before your contract ends, or you\'ll be charged for another year of property management software.',
        employee: 'Alert your finance or procurement team about this early cancellation deadline to avoid unwanted charges.',
        customer: 'Set a reminder 4 months before your renewal date so you have time to evaluate alternatives if needed.',
        business_owner: 'This long notice period could affect your budget planning. Consider negotiating shorter notice periods in future contracts.',
